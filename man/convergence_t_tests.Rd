\title{Computes convergence diagnistics}
\usage{
convergence_t_tests(samples, window_size = nrow(samples)/20)
}
\arguments{
\item{samples}{Samples from a CoalHMM MCMC run.}

\item{window_size}{Size of windows to use in the t-tests.}
}
\value{
A data frame with p-values for the t-tests in each window.
}
\description{
Computes a very simple convergence diagnistic based on a t-test for equal means for different
windows of the chain. For each window, each parameter is compared with the samples from the last
half of the data and the t-test p-value is computed.
}
\details{
Keep in mind that this function only compare means. It is not a complete diagnistic of convergence
since samples from two windows can be very different and still have the same mean. Generally, though,
the CoalHMM runs tends to have very different means if they are not converged.
