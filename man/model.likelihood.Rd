\title{Computes the model likelihood from MCMC posterior samples}
\usage{
model.likelihood(samples, burn.in = 0)
}
\arguments{
\item{samples}{A data frame with the samples from an MCMC run.}

\item{burn.in}{The number of samples to discard as burn-in samples.}
}
\value{
The model likelihood \eqn{P(D | M)}.
}
\description{
Computes the so-called model likelihood, that is the probability of the data given the model,
\eqn{P(D | M) = \int P(D | \theta, M) P(\theta | M) d\theta}, based on samples from an MCMC run.
The ratio between two model likelihoods from different models is the Bayes factor and can be
used for model selection.

\details{
Computes the so-called model likelihood, that is the probability of the data given the model,
\eqn{P(D | M) = \int P(D | \theta, M) P(\theta | M) d\theta}.

Since the samples from the MCMC are from the posterior and not the prior distribution the likelihood
cannot be computed simply as the mean of the likelihood -- and typically that would be a very
inefficient approach to computing the likelihood -- so instead the harmonic mean of the likelihood
sampled from the posterior is used. This follows from
\deqn{\int P(\theta | D, M) / P(D | \theta, M) d\theta
 = \int 1/P(D | M) [P(D | \theta, M)P(\theta | M)]/P(D | \theta, M) d\theta
 = 1/P(D | M)
}
so \eqn{1/P(D | M) = \int 1/P(D | \theta, M) P(\theta | D, M) d\theta}
which is approximated from samples from the posterior \eqn{P(\theta | D, M)}.
